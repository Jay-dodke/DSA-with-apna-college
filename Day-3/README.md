## 🧘 What Happened Today
Today I could not continue Java & DSA learning due to health issues.  
Taking rest to recover and come back stronger 🙌

## 🌱 Why This Matters
Learning is a **long journey**, not a one-day sprint.
Missing a day is normal — returning with energy is success.

✔ Resume Day-3  
✔ Cover Day-4 together  
✔ Build momentum  
✔ Push code + notes + commits

> “Discipline doesn’t mean never stopping.  
> It means starting again after every stop.”

> “Rest is also part of the plan.”
