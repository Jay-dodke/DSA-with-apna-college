DAY — Health/Backlog Day
Date: 12 January 2026

No new Java topic studied today because of health and rest.

Important notes to remember:
• One missed day doesn't break consistency
• Returning next day is true discipline
• Health comes before code
• Tomorrow I will complete Day-3 and Day-4 together

Plan for tomorrow:
1) Conditionals (if/else)
2) Comparison & logical operators
3) Loop basics (while, for, do-while)
4) Write and practice programs
5) Add notes + README + commit + push

Motivation:
“The harder you work, the luckier you get.”
“Slow progress is still progress.”
“Comeback > Perfect streak.”
