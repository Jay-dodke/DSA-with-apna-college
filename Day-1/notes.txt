Day 1 Notes — Flowchart & Pseudocode
------------------------------------

🧠 What I learned today:
Today I learned how to think like a programmer.
Before writing code, we must understand the logic clearly.

-------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Flowchart (Simple Meaning)
A flowchart is a map of our code.
It uses shapes and arrows to show:
➡ where we start
➡ what steps we do
➡ where we check a condition (YES/NO)
➡ when we stop

It helps us SEE the solution before coding.

-------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Pseudocode (Simple Meaning)
Pseudocode is like writing code in English.
It is not real code.
It is instructions for what the program should do.

Example pseudocode steps:
1. Start
2. Input number
3. Add number to sum
4. Print the sum
5. Stop

When pseudocode is clear,
code becomes super easy to write.

-------------------------------------------------------------
📌 Problems I solved today:

1️⃣ **Max of 3 Numbers**
- Take 3 numbers a, b, c
- Check:
   → If a > b:
        → if a > c → a is max
        → else → c is max
   → Else:
        → if b > c → b is max
        → else → c is max

👁‍🗨 Idea: Compare numbers step by step instead of together.

-------------------------------------------------------------

2️⃣ **Sum of first N natural numbers**
- Set total = 0
- Start val from 1
- Keep adding val to total until val = n
- Increase val each step

Example: n=5  
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15

👁‍🗨 Idea: Loop repeats the same action until condition ends.

-------------------------------------------------------------

3️⃣ **Find if a number is Prime**
- A prime number has only 2 factors: 1 and itself
- Start checking divisors from 2
- If any number divides n perfectly → NOT prime
- If none divide → PRIME

Example:  
6 → divisible by 2 → not prime  
5 → divisible by none → prime

👁‍🗨 Idea: Stop early if we find a divisor.

🎯 My Understanding Today
✔ Logic comes before coding  
✔ Coding is easy when logic is clear  
✔ Flowchart + pseudocode = brain preparation  
✔ Every programmer follows these steps mentally
