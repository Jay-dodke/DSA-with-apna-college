# 🚀 Java DSA with Apna College — Day 1  
**Author:** Jay  
**Date Started:** 10 January 2026  
**Instructor:** Shraddha Khapra (Apna College)

## 🌟 What I Did Today
**Day 1 of my Java + DSA Journey begins!**  
I learned how to think logically using **Flowcharts** and **Pseudocode**,  
which is the foundation of every programming language 🔥

---

## 📚 Topics Covered
### 🧩 1️⃣ Max of 3 Numbers  
- Take `a, b, c`
- Compare step-by-step
- Print the greatest

### ➕ 2️⃣ Sum of First N Natural Numbers  
- Add values from `1 → n`
- Understand loops + counters

### 🔍 3️⃣ Check if a Number is Prime  
- Start with divisor `2`
- If any divisor divides `n`
  - Not prime ❌
- Else → Prime ✔

## 🧠 Key Learnings
- Flowchart = **visual roadmap of logic**
- Pseudocode = **write logic in plain English before coding**
- Coding comes LAST → Thinking comes FIRST 💡

## 💪 Motivation of the Day
> “Consistency beats intensity.”  
> “The harder you work, the luckier you get.”  
> “One day at a time, but every day counts.”

## 🎯 Next Goals (Day 2 Preview)
- Learn Java syntax  
- Variables, loops, input output  
- Start converting pseudocode → real code confidently

---

##  Final Thought
This is just **Day 1** —  
but today I built the mindset that will carry me through  
DSA, coding interviews, and real-world development 🚀
